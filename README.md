# GreatCap

GreatCap is an app that allows you to edit, save and schedule Instagram Captions. You can create templates, link them together and edit them. It is also possible to create hashtag lists and integrate them. You can then save your captions and tag them with a date and the image you created the caption for.
You can simply copy the captions into your clipboard, formatted and with line breaks, and then enter them into Instagram.
The app is supposed to run as Android and IOS app, that's why Flutter is used and as reduced version also Mobile.
